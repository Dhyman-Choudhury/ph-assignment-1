                <p>Poverty is a threat to peace. I believe putting resources into improving the lives of poor people is a better strategy than spending it on guns. Bangladesh has taught me many lessons, and the most important is that the poor are not the problem—they are the solution. Unleashing their creativity and energy brings amazing results. My country, Bangladesh, has shown how social business can be a powerful tool to tackle challenges like poverty, unemployment, and inequality. Together, we can create a world where poverty exists only in museums.</p>
